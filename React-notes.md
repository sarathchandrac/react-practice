# practices
* DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself - Figure your absolute minimal representation of the state the application needs, Everything else need to be computed on demand
* React is all about one-way data flow down the component hirarchy
* State of the component is created in the component and passed down to the child components.
* All state is not created equal

```
npm install npm@latest -g

#eslint for runtime checking for errors and dynamic suggestions
